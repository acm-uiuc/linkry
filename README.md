# Linkry - ACM @ UIUC Link Shortener

Linkry is an internal tool for shortening links and reducing link rot by redirecting users to an origin site from an ACM-controlled link.

## Installation

Ensure that you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed on your machine. For non-ACM users, configure config.js to use your AAD tenant's client ID.
Then, run the following commands:
```bash
yarn
export proto=http
export baseURL=localhost:9215
export SESSION_DB_FILE_LOC=$PWD
export SESSION_DB_FILE_NAME=db.sqlite3 
export DB_FILE=db.sqlite3
export CLIENT_SECRET=<your azure AD secret here>
yarn dev
```

## Usage

Linkry integrates with Azure AD to only allow authorized Epoch users to create links redirections. After you log in with your Epoch credentials, you will be presented with a portal that will allow you to shorten links. In the navigation bar, there is also a "My Links" tab that will allow you to delete or edit any links you have previously made.
